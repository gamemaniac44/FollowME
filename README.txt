*****ChangeLog*****
1)  New design and theme!
2)  New application Logo!
3)  New Splash Screen!
4)  Registration Screen now scrolls when the device keyboard is opened.
5)  Database optimizations.
6)  



1)  Fixed a few GoogleMap bugs and errors.
			-GPS retrieving old store location and marking as start point has now been fixed.
			-Battery life was consumed when user pressed device home button with application still open because GPS was still running.  Now GPS is paused when user hits home button and resumes upon reopening of application.
			-GPS recording will not resume if the user presses the home button on their devices if they have already pressed stop to stop GPS location updates.
			-Fixed issue where the application would crash if the user pressed the stop button two times repeatedly.
			-Fixed issue where a recording GPS message was displayed as many times as the user pressed start GPS menu button.  Now the message is only displayed one time until the user hits the stop button and represses the start.
2)  Action overflow menu button deemed unnecessary  and has been removed from the menu bar.
